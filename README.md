# HoneyICS: A High-interaction Physics-aware Honeynet for Industrial Control Systems

This repository contains the source code and necessary files for the paper "HoneyICS: A High-interaction Physics-aware Honeynet for Industrial Control Systems".

## Abstract

Industrial control systems (ICSs) are vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks, i.e., security breaches in cyberspace that adversely affect the underline physical processes. In this context, honeypots are ideal countermeasures both to defend against such attacks and discover new attack strategies. In recent years, Honeypots for ICSs have made several progresses in trying to faithfully reproduce the behavior of OT networks, including physical process interactions. We propose a high-interaction, physics-aware, scalable, and extensible honeynet for ICSs, equipped with an advanced monitoring system. We deployed our honeynet on the Internet and conducted experiments to compare it with existing ICS honeypots.


## Contents

This repository contains the following directories:

- **PLCs**

    This directory contains the source code to build the software PLC that can be used in the honeynet. The PLCs' codes are implemented in ladder logic and are designed to simulate the behavior of real-world ICSs.

- **Proxy**

    This directory contains the source code for the proxy servers used in the honeynet. The proxies are responsible for forwarding traffic between the PLCs.

- **Matlab Simulink**

    This directory contains the source code for the Matlab Simulink models used in the honeynet and the Dockerfile to build the container. The models are used to simulate the physical processes controlled by the PLCs. To run it you will need an active Matlab License

- **Attacks**

    This directory contains the attack files used in the experiments conducted in the paper. The directory is further divided into subdirectories for each attack. Each subdirectory contains the necessary files to execute the attack, including scripts, payloads, and configuration files.

## Overview

Within this repository, we have provided detailed instructions on how to successfully replicate our honeynet and execute the attacks outlined in our published article.

> While it is possible to install all necessary components on a singular machine, we highly recommend allocating the simulink container to a distinct device in order to circumvent any unforeseen issues arising from potential RAM depletion.

The honeynet comprises several components:  HMIs, PLCs, proxies, plant, management and  monitoring dashboards, and probes. Each element is containerized using Docker technology.

Specifically, the HMI component is built using ScadaBR, and its container is designed to automatically generate a view using a headless version of Selenium. Additionally, the HMI container connects to the PLCs using the entries plc1.net, plc2.net, and plc3.net, which may need to be modified to suit your specific configuration.

The PLC container, is built using  [OpenPLC](https://openplcproject.com/) and  [HoneyD](https://www.honeyd.org/) , with the use of  [HoneyPLC](https://github.com/sefcom/honeyplc) improvements. The PLCs are automatically loaded with the ladder logic for the use case illustrated below.

### Use case

![Alt text](readme/images/swat.png)
The use case, we considered is inspired by
[Lanotte et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10668), consisting of a network of three PLCs to control
(a simplified version of) the [iTrust Secure Water Treatment system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7469060&tag=1) (SWaT).
For simplicity, we consider only three stages, with three tanks.

- Stage 1:

    -   Raw water is pumped into an 80-gallon tank T-201 via pump P-101.
    -   A valve MV-301 connects tank T-201 to a filtration unit that releases treated water into a second tank T-202 (with a capacity of 20 gallons).
    -   Water in T-202 flows into a reverse osmosis unit to reduce inorganic impurities.

- Stage 2:

    -   PLC-1 manages tank T-201 and controls the water level.
    -   PLC-2 manages tank T-202 and controls the valve opening/closing.
    -   The valve remains open when the tank is refilling and closed when it is emptying.
    -   If the water level in T-201 reaches its low setpoint, the pump is turned on and the valve is closed. If it reaches its high setpoint, the pump is turned off.

-  Stage 3:

    -   PLC-3 manages the backwash tank T-203 and controls the pump P-102.
    -   If the water level in T-203 reaches the low setpoint, the pump is turned off. If it reaches the high setpoint, the entire content of T-203 is pumped back into the filtration unit of T-202.

-  Additional: 
    - The HMI is used to visualize the status of the three tanks and their components.

### Network
The expected network outcome of the honeynet is illustrated in the following picture.

![Alt text](readme/images/network.png)

To ensure secure communication and prevent lateral movement, each PLC is situated on an individual network with a proxy serving as its default gateway. These proxies are strategically positioned in front of the PLCs, enabling bi-directional communication management. 

Moreover, the placement of probes directly on the proxy will facilitate the seamless capture of data transmitted to physical devices, providing scope for future enhancement.

## Setup

In each subdirectory where it is deemed necessary, comprehensive guidelines on utilizing each component of the honeynet can be found within the README.md file.

## Attacks

### Attack 1

**Description**

The attack assumes that both PLCs and HMIs are accessible on the Internet.
This attack is a DoS on pump P-101 governed by PLC-1 to achieve a overflow of tank T-201.

-   When the level of tank T-201 reaches the high setpoint of 80 gallons, the attacker forces the pump to remain on.
-   To accomplish this, the attacker uses a script that performs the following actions:
    -   Transmits a Modbus packet to read the analog input register associated with the level of tank T-101.
    -   When the level of tank T-101 reaches 80 gallons, the script continuously sends a different Modbus packet with the function code "write single discrete output coil" 0x05 to set the PLC register associated with pump P-101 to True.
-   As a result, the attacker can achieve an overflow of tank T-201 regardless of the state of valve MV-301.

**How to perform the attack**

To perform the attack described above on your attacker machine:

1.  Navigate to the `attacks/attack1` folder.

>**Note: If you wish to continue please keep in mind that the authors of this project do not condone any malicious use of the information provided and will not be held responsible for any damages resulting from such actions.**

2.  Modify the IP address of PLC1 with the public IP address of your own PLC1.
3.  Launch the attack by running the `python attack1.py` command.

### Attack 2

**Description**

In this attack, we assume that the HMI is exposed on the Internet. (Note that the HMI container hosts ScadaBR, version 1.0CE.)
The attacker exploits the authenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability CVE-2021-26828 of ScadaBR to gain complete control of the HMI and carry out a MITM attack to cause the physical system to deadlock.
By exploiting CVE-2021-26828 combined with the use of default credential vulnerability, the attacker gains a web shell on the container. This, in turn, grants remote command execution, which is exploited to upload a statically linked Golang binary that does the following:
1.  It keeps transmitting a Modbus packet, with function code read discrete output coil 0x01, to read the PLC register associated with valve MV-301.
2.  It sends a second Modbus packet, with function code read analog input register 0x04, to read the PLC register associated with the level of tank T-101.
3.  Finally, when the level of the tank approaches the value 80 Gallons and the valve is still closed, the attacker drops all Modbus packets transmitted from PLC-2 to PLC-1 to intercept all requests to open valve MV-301.
4.  As a consequence, the valve remains closed and, in the long run, the system reaches the following deadlock state: tank T-201 is full (without overflow), and tanks T-202 and T-203 both face underflow.

**How to perform the attack**

To perform the attack described above on your attacker machine:

1.  Make sure Go is installed on your system. You can check if it's installed by running the command `go version` in a terminal window. If Go is not installed, you can download it from the official website: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
    
2.  Clone the `arpfox` repository from Github by running the following command in your terminal window:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/malfunkt/arpfox.git` 
    
3.  Navigate to the `arpfox` directory by running the following command:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cd arpfox` 
    
4.  Build the executable by running the following command:
    
    goCopy code
    
    `go build .` 
    
    This command will build the executable in the current directory.
    
5.  To extract the executable, navigate to the directory where the executable is located (`arpfox` directory in this case). You can copy or move the executable to another directory if you want.

>**Note: If you wish to continue please keep in mind that the authors of this project do not condone any malicious use of the information provided and will not be held responsible for any damages resulting from such actions.**

6.  Download the exploit from [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49735](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49735)
2.  Open a listener on the attacker machine to receive the reverse shell connection from the target machine
3.  Launch the exploit, providing the public IP of the HMI as input
4.  Upload the `arpfox` executable and the Python script, along with the necessary libraries, through the reverse shell
5.  Launch the Python script
6.  Once the Python script outputs "Begin the attack", execute the `arpfox` binary to divert the communication between PLC1 and PLC2.

### Attack 3

**Description**

In this attack, we assume that our honeynet is under a compromised VPN, and the attacker aims to perform a stealthy DoS attack on pump P-102 that is controlled by PLC3. The attack involves forcing the pump to continue working even when the tank T-203 reaches the low setpoint 0 Gallons, leading to the eventual breakdown of the pump.

The attacker accomplishes this by utilizing a script that continuously transmits Modbus packets with the function code "read analog input register 0x04" to read the PLC register linked to the tank T-203's level. Once the tank level reaches the low3 setpoint, the script sends a different Modbus packet with the function code "write single discrete output coil 0x05" to manipulate the PLC register associated with pump P-102, forcing it to remain on even in the absence of water.

To remain undetected, the attacker sets up a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and sends Modbus packets to the HMI interface indicating that the pump is off (function code "write single discrete output coil 0x05"), while it is actually still running. This attack aims to deceive operators into thinking that everything is working normally while the pump continues to work, leading to its eventual breakdown.

**How to perform the attack**

1. Connect to the compromised VPN.

>**Note: If you wish to continue please keep in mind that the authors of this project do not condone any malicious use of the information provided and will not be held responsible for any damages resulting from such actions.**


1.  Use the script attacks/attack3/attack3-capture.py to keep transmitting a Modbus packet, with function code read analog input register 0x04, to read the PLC registers and coils and saves the values in JSON format.
    
2.  Once the level reaches the value 0 Gallons, keep transmitting a different Modbus packet, with function code write single discrete output coil 0x05, to manipulate the PLC register associated with pump P-102. This will force the pump to remain on, even in the absence of water, and eventually break.
    
3.  To remain stealthy, set up a MITM attack using the binary previously built and starts the python script attacks/attack3/attack3-server.py that serves the values previously recorded.
